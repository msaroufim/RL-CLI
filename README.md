# RL-CLI

The goal of RL-CLI is to make  it really easy to try out different RL algorithms in different environments. Contribution of this project is a wrapper around the Open AI baselines algorithms (add link) and the Open AI retro game evironments.

Current support is limited to  Deep Q learning on any retro game.

## Usage

```
rl 'algorithm-name' 'game-name'
```

If you'd like to run multiple configurations of algorithms and games you can open up a new shell and run it again.

### Backlog
* Support more algorithms
* Output more performance metrics
* Output performance metrics in Tensorboard
* Model checkpoints
